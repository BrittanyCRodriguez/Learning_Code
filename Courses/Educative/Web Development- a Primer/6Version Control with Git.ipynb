    "\n",
    "Since the command line interface allows you to control the computer directly by typing commands, many tasks can be performed more efficiently. For example, if you want to make one change in the names of around 2000 files, you can use a for loop on the command line and change the names of all of them in a few seconds. Therefore basic knowledge of the command line is an absolute essential.\n",

    "The user interface that accepts typed commands and displays data on the screen is called a **shell**. There is a wide variety of shells that you can choose from, but the most common is the **Bash shell** (https://www.gnu.org/software/bash/), which is the default on Linux and Mac systems in the Terminal application. Windows systems only include the anemic Command Prompt application by default, which is nowhere near as powerful as Bash. If you’re going to follow along on your windows machine, however, consider installing **cygwin** (https://www.cygwin.com/).\n",

If you do, you’d have to figure out what exactly your fellow team member changed when they send it back to you and somehow merge that onto your file with your new code. This combing for changes and merging is not only tedious work but is prone to human error. Furthermore, the time spent doing so can be spent more productively on actually writing code.

Now in a Git-less situation, if you start working on both features and you finish the navigation bar in a week but need 3 more weeks to enable comments, you won’t be able to make your navigation bar live until the comments feature is done as well. So you would have to work on features sequentially if you want to make them live as they get completed, which means a loss in productivity.\n",

It is contained within the repository but does not affect the primary or master branch allowing you to work freely without disrupting the “live” version. When you’ve made the changes you want to make, you can merge your branch back into the master branch to publish your changes. For more information, see ‘About branches.’” Branches are primarily used to create new features, and they can be merged back into the master branch (the main branch) after making a pull request."
