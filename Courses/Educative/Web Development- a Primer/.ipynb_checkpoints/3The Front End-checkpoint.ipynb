HTML was originally designed as a structural language, but with time and updates, it has been turned into a tool for presentation which uses fonts, colors, and other visual elements. The purpose of CSS is to restore HTML to its original status as a structural language. In other words, cascading style sheets are a way to format your page layout, text, fonts, images, and almost anything that controls the look and feel of your web page. This leaves HTML with the structural work only."
