    "DBMS, short for Database Management System, is essentially a sort of nuance added to web development that allows data to be separated from the logic of the application and stored separately to be retrieved and processed when required. What this means is that data is stored in a database that has an entirely autonomous system governing it. THe application then makes calls to this database for any required data without having to integrate large amounts of handling code within the application code itself. They are important because they provide a highly efficient method for handling multiple types of data, without interfering with the application's code."

    "SQL databases, also known as *relational databases*, use structured query language (SQL) for defining and manipulating data. On the one hand, this is extremely useful since SQL is one of the most versatile and widely-used options available, thus making it a safe choice and especially great for complex queries. On the other hand, it can be restrictive, too, since SQL requires that you use predefined schemas to determine the structure of your data before you work with it. Moreover, data is always stored as a table in SQL databases, which leads to inefficient and complicated data retrievals. In addition, all of your data must follow the same structure. This can require significant effort and may lead to a highly complicated data processing code that can affect the quality of the overall application.\n",

These databases can grow dynamically, and the structure of data can vary from database to database.\n",

    "## The transition to NoSQL\n",
    "\n",
    "Speed is amongst the most important factors that affect user experience on a web application. Relying on an unnecessary number of calls to a database usually tends to slow things down for users, and it is, therefore, important for web developers to keep some commonly requested chunks of data in immediate storage so that they can be retrieved quickly, without creating large latencies in displaying data. To do so, web developers need to think about how to get as much data in memory as reasonably possible, and then how to get things cached at the file system level to avoid making calls to a database altogether. The reason for this is that retrieving data from a database is the bottleneck of most web applications, and decreasing these operations can significantly improve responsiveness. The process of selecting commonly requested data components and storing them in immediate memory to avoid extraneous database calls is referred to as **caching**, and NoSQL databases have gained popularity in recent times because of their ability to automatically cache data to enhance performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "In addition to this, the database calls themselves are more inefficient in SQL databases than in NoSQL databases. This is because SQL databases store data in tabular form, and queries require comprehensive iterations of the table. NoSQL databases, on the other hand, use data structures to store entries, which means that lookups are always optimized and database calls are much more efficient. Consequently, with modern web applications increasingly requiring fast response times to achieve intended functionality, the shift towards using NoSQL databases has been apparent in recent times."

    "**MongoDB**, which is possibly the most popular NoSQL DBMS, is an open-source non-relational database management system that has come to be known as the leading option when it comes to developing modern web applications. MongoDB uses a document-based storage system that stores key-value pairs and allows for highly efficient lookups, making data retrievals much faster and easier than any typical SQL DBMS. The document model ensures that data can be mapped directly to objects within the application code, and is, therefore, makes data handling significantly easy by eliminating the need for adding code to process queried data. MongoDB stores data in a highly flexible manner, thus allowing for fields to vary from document to document and the structure of data to be open to change over time. Data can also be indexed and queried according to specific user requirements and then updated in real-time. This makes MongoDB and exceptionally powerful system for data analysis, and that shows in its popularity. However, the most important aspect of quality that MongoDB covers is reliability; MongoDB is a distributed database at its core which means that it is available, scalable, and easily distributable across locations, thus making it well equipped for modern applications that require quick access to data at all times.\n",

In order to do this, caches are used at each level starting from the server itself all the way to users’ browsers, and each of them is meant to store data that users are very likely to request.\n",
    "\n",
    "Essentially, web caching works by caching HTTP responses for certain requests according to a probabilistic analysis of requests that are frequently observed on the server. Subsequent requests for cached content can then be fulfilled from a cache closer to the user instead of having to send the request all the way back to the web server, which then makes a call to the database for the required data.\n",
