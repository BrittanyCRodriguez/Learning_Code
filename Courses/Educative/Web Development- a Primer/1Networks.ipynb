Therefore, routers are a more powerful version of switches and the Internet is comprised of a mix of both that facilitate the transfer of data between end-systems.\n",

This is done by dividing the data, which is just a set of bits, that needs to be transferred into several smaller chunks of bits known as **Packets** and then sending each packet to its destination independently. The reason for this is that you cannot always send large amounts of data in a single packet because it is highly likely that data in large packets get corrupted on the path from its source to its destination due to a bit flip during transmissions. It is, therefore, more efficient and reliable to send multiple smaller packets."

The primarily used protocol for communication between a web application and a browser is referred to as the Transmission Control Protocol (TCP). TCP is a *transport layer* protocol that takes the responsibility of transmitting data and ensures reliable data transfer between clients and servers across the web. The way TCP does this is by adding additional information to data packets that allow for packet authentication and by allowing the exchange of acknowledgement messages between the client and server to confirm data transmissions.\n",

Sockets are opened on ports to allow processes to send an receive messages. Ports are designated by numbers, all ports below 1024 are associated with a specific protocol each by default. The port number for HTTP is 80, this means that any messages you send or receive on the web come in to and leave your machine on a socket at port 80. Ports above 1024 are **open ports** available to programmers to use for any process they want to communicate with a network. They can build sockets on these ports and define the structure and type of messages this socket can cater to through *socket programming*. Socket Programming is and aspect of Computer Networks that is beyond the scope of this discussion, but is a highly useful skill to get under your belt."

You may be wondering now where the IP address comes in if you reach websites through URLs. Well, thatâ€™s where DNS comes in. Routers across the web do not store URLs for every single website hosted on the Internet; they only know IP addresses and forward packets towards their destinations based on them. Users, however, only know URLs, or domain names, for the websites they are visiting. To bridge this clear gap of information, the Internet makes use of **DNS servers**, which serve as translational intermediaries between end-systems and the routers that serve to forward data packets coming from them to their destinations. The process of making a lookup for a domain name on a DNS server and obtaining its corresponding IP address is referred to as a **DNS resolution**."
